Step-by-step Implementation
Card Class: Represents a single playing card with attributes like suit and rank.

    def __init__(self, suit, rank):
        self.suit = suit

Deck Class: Represents a deck of 52 cards, capable of shuffling and dealing cards.

Player Class: Represents a player (both the player and the dealer will be instances of this class).

Game Logic: Handles the main flow of the game, including initialization, player actions (hit, stand), and comparison of hands.
